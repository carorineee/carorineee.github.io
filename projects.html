              <h3>Votebot (December 2015)</h3>
              <p>This is a program I wrote in Python that simulates voting on an online poll. My original goal was to learn how to use Requests and proxies, but in the process, I also learned how to use the BeautifulSoup parser as well. I first used requests to fetch the poll form, then used BeautifulSoup to parse the code, then extracted the needed information and sent a new vote via requests through a proxy. Note: This project was solely for learning purposes and had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I wanted Jimi Hendrix to win. </p>

            <h3>Perooze (November 2015) </h3>
            <p>Perooze is an iOS app I built that implements Google's Tesseract OCR to make searching for specific words in a text easier. It's sort of like a real life control find. The user takes a picture of a piece of text, and the app turns the words into digital form. Then, the user can enter a word to search for, and the app will highlight where the word is in the text. This was my very first exposure to iOS development, and it was such a great learning experience. It is currently on the iOS App Store. </p>

            <h3>HackTX: Do-Dates (September 2015)</h3>
            <p>HackTX was my very first hackathon, and what an experience it was! My teammates and I developed a web app and a mobile app called <strong>Do-Dates</strong> that is targeted towards students. It takes a syllabus, reads the information, and then extracts the assignments and due dates via an OCR, putting them in a to-do list and a calendar. While we didn't finish the project as we only had 24 hours, we still managed to get pretty far, as we managed to build both the web app and mobile app, and we managed to extract the information from the syllabus. I was responsible for front-end development of the web app, so it was a good chance for me to practice my web development skills. </p>

            <p>Mobile App Development is an organization at UT that aims to help students interested in app and web development. They host weekly workshops for beginners. I have attended the weekly iOS workshops since day 0 (since we're indexing :P). The workshops helped tremendously in getting started with iOS development, and the instructors were very knowledgeable. I have also attended hack events hosted by MAD such as Local Hack Day and MAD Hack Nights. I plan on being involved with MAD for the rest of my time at UT!</p>
