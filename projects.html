      <h3>Perooze (November 2015) </h3>

      <p>Perooze is an iOS app I built that implements Google's Tesseract OCR to make searching for specific words in a text easier. It's sort of like a real life control find. The user takes a picture of a piece of text, and the app turns the words into digital form. Then, the user can enter a word to search for, and the app will highlight where the word is in the text. This was my very first exposure to iOS development, and it was such a great learning experience. It is currently in review for the app store. </p>

      <h3>HackTX: Do-Dates (September 2015)</h3>
      <hr width="1200">
      <p>HackTX was my very first hackathon, and what an experience it was! My teammates and I developed a web app and a mobile app called <strong>Do-Dates</strong> that is targeted towards students. It takes a syllabus, reads the information, and then extracts the assignments and due dates, putting them in a to-do list and a calendar. While we didn't finish the project as we only had 24 hours, we still managed to get pretty far, as we managed to build both the web app and mobile app, and we managed to extract the information from the syllabus. I was responsible for front-end development of the web app, so it was a good chance for me to practice my web development skills. </p>

      <h3>MAD: Mobile App Development (September 2015 - present)</h3>
      <hr width="1200">
      <p>Mobile App Development is an organization at UT that aims to help students interested in app and web development. They host weekly workshops for beginners. I have attended the weekly iOS workshops since day 0 (since we're indexing :P), and I have enjoyed it very much. The workshops helped tremendously in getting started with iOS development, and the instructors were very knowledgeable. The semester of MAD culminated in my submission of Perooze to the app store! I hope to still be involved with MAD for the rest of my time at UT!</p>
